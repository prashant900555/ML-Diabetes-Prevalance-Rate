# ML-Diabetes-Prevalance-Rate
The objective of this question is to gain insight from a dataset released by Tesco store, a large supermarket chain in UK. The dataset describes the purchasing behaviour of shoppers aggregated at the Ward level. It describes the fraction of different product types in the overall shopping basket. The features in this dataset are a subset of the Tesco dataset available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Arealevel_ grocery_purchases/7796666 and you can find the description of the various fields there. The last column in this dataset is a categorical feature that captures the diabetes prevalence rate in the ward and your task is to predict this categorical feature based on the features derived from the shopping behaviour.
